            <h2>What Is Calisthenics ?</h2><br>
            <p>Calisthenics (American English) is a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements that
                exercise large muscle groups (gross motor movements), such as standing, grasping, pushing, etc. These
                exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises. They are
                intended to increase strength, fitness, and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing,
                bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's body weight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the
                benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as
                balance, agility, and coordination. A study done in 2017 titled "The effects of a calisthenics training
                intervention on posture, strength and body composition" found that calisthenics training is an
                "effective training solution to improve posture, strength and body composition without the use of any
                major training equipment".

                Urban calisthenics is a form of Street Workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban
                areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups, levers,
                and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.

                Sports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of
                synchronized physical training (often including a customized "call and response" routine) to increase
                group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics is also popular as a component of physical education in
                primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.</p>

            <p>Calisthenics is better for burning calories, which in turn may help you lose weight and body fat. That's
                because it uses a lot of movement. ... The more calories you burn, the more weight you lose.
                Calisthenics can also be used in more vigorous workouts, like high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or
                circuit training,Not only will you build great functional strength, making everyday tasks easier, but by
                reducing stress on your joints while building that strength, results in a longer lifespan for those
                joints. Calisthenics actually increase your resting metabolic rate, as well as enhance and develop
                muscular and aerobic endurance</p><br>
            <p>Pick bodybuilding workout if you want to build muscle mass (increase your size) and improve the overall
                strength of your body. When it comes to weight loss, calisthenics workouts are a better choice, since it
                burns more calories compared to bodyweight exercises</p><br>
