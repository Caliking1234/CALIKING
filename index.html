                <h2>What is Calisthenics ?</h2><br>
                <p>Calisthenics (American English) is a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements
                    that
                    exercise large muscle groups (gross motor movements), such as standing, grasping, pushing, etc.
                    These
                    exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises. They
                    are
                    intended to increase strength, fitness, and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing,
                    bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's body weight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the
                    benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as
                    balance, agility, and coordination. A study done in 2017 titled "The effects of a calisthenics
                    training
                    intervention on posture, strength and body composition" found that calisthenics training is an
                    "effective training solution to improve posture, strength and body composition without the use of
                    any
                    major training equipment".

                    Urban calisthenics is a form of Street Workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in
                    urban
                    areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups,
                    levers,
                    and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.

                    Sports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of
                    synchronized physical training (often including a customized "call and response" routine) to
                    increase
                    group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics is also popular as a component of physical education in
                    primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.</p>

                <h2>Why Calisthenics ?</h2><br>
                <p>Calisthenics is better for burning calories, which in turn may help you lose weight and body fat.
                    That's
                    because it uses a lot of movement. ... The more calories you burn, the more weight you lose.
                    Calisthenics can also be used in more vigorous workouts, like high-intensity interval training
                    (HIIT) or
                    circuit training,Not only will you build great functional strength, making everyday tasks easier,
                    but by
                    reducing stress on your joints while building that strength, results in a longer lifespan for those
                    joints. Calisthenics actually increase your resting metabolic rate, as well as enhance and develop
                    muscular and aerobic endurance</p><br>
                <p>Pick bodybuilding workout if you want to build muscle mass (increase your size) and improve the
                    overall
                    strength of your body. When it comes to weight loss, calisthenics workouts are a better choice,
                    since it
                    burns more calories compared to bodyweight exercises</p><br>
